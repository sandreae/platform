<h1>About</h1>
<p>Rhizomatic is a space for community discourse, where publications by contributors act as points of departure for ideas and conversations. Rhizomatic aims to provide a space for community-generated discourse through creative action. Each Rhizomatic community defines itself, and the structures they function within, encouraging conversation through expression.</p>
<p>Contributors create publications within topic-specific Rhizomatic instances and build discourse(s) organically through activity. The publications are created and hosted on rhizomatic.community and can be composed of markdown documents, single media uploads, or mixed-media collages. Each publication invites responses, a discourse emerges from the process of openly expressing ideas.</p>
<p>Rhizomatic is a place where new communities can form, or existing ones can initiate a creative discussion environment.</p>
