<h1>About</h1>
<p>Rhizomatic is a space for community discourse, where publications by contributors act as points of departure for ideas and conversations. Rhizomatic aims to provide a space for community-generated discourse through creative action. Each Rhizomatic community defines itself, and the structures they function within, encouraging conversation through expression.</p>
<p>Contributors create publications within topic-specific Rhizomatic instances and build discourse(s) organically through activity. The publications are created and hosted on rhizomatic.community and can be composed of markdown documents, single media uploads, or mixed-media collages. Each publication invites responses, a discourse emerges from the process of openly expressing ideas.</p>
<p>Rhizomatic is a place where new communities can form, or existing ones can initiate a creative discussion environment.</p>

<h2>Inspiration</h2>
<p>The inspiration for Rhizomatic came from various communities (both online and offline) that we have taken part of in over the years.</p>
<p>These are, in no particular order:</p>
<a href="http://blatt3000.de">BLATT 3000</a><br />
<a href="http://www.verantwortung3000.de">VERANTWORTUNG 3000</a><br />

<h2>Future</h2>
<p>Rhizomatic is an ongoing project and there are many ideas we want to take further in the future. Below is a list of what we already have planned, please get in touch if you think you could help us implement anything, or if you have other suggestions for us.</p>
<h3>P2P / Distributed Web</h3>
<p>We’re following developments within the p2p web community, if it’s possible to decentralize our hosting that would be very nice.<br />

<h3>Discourse</h3>
<p>We are planning to integrate a <a href="https://www.discourse.org/">discourse</a> forum into Rhizomatic so that discussions can happen there too.</p>
<h3>Ever More Beautiful</h3>
<p>The Rhizomes view when browsing publications could be more beautiful, if you have creative ideas <a href="http://www.rhizomatic.community/contact">contact us</a>.</p>
<h3>More input types</h3>
<p>Any other ideas for input types? Here are ours:<br />
A git repository<br />
Code<br />
Documentation<br />
Event</p>
<h2>Get Involved</h2>
<p>Each Rhizome begins with a seed, which is directed at other users, which can then respond to the initial seed and invite additional responses, creating an iterative and engaged discussion around a general subject.</p>
<p>Once you have responded to a publication invite, you are free to seed a new Rhizome, inviting as many users as you see fit. This new Rhizome will form searchable and organic connections to adjacent Rhizome instances, creating an intertwined and interconnected web of thoughts and discussion.</p>
<p>You can also choose to get involved with the conceptual and/or technical development by emailing <a href="mailto:contact@rhizomatic.community">contact@rhizomatic.community</a> or creating a pull request on the github repo: <a href="https://github.com/sandreae/rhizomatic">https://github.com/sandreae/platform</a></p>
