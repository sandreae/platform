collage view:

- remove editing elements when viewing
-hitting “Save” on the ‘new publication’ page should take you directly into the ‘edit contents’ page
-the “delete” button needs a few warnings before just nuking the pub!
-hitting ‘publish’ should be a terminal destination in that you go to the forcemap view AND close the sidebar
-i dont remember if we talked about this, but are we going to have a ‘user’ page at all? (especially if we’re including anonymity). this can possibly fall as just a filter
-logout should be in the ‘right’ sidebar (from what i remember, the right one had the login/logout, and was the ‘user’ one (hence the ‘Your Publications’ being there), and the left sidebar has the about/publications/etc…
publish error: shouldn't publish unless validation ok.
Validation as behaviours for all views
-in the ‘new publication’ view, “Publication Date:” should default to today (and have a little calendar icon in the date field)

change pub type button
position of validation error text

-hitting the X in the sidebar should return you to the previous view (so if im in the ‘Your Publications’ view, and click on ‘edit details’ or whatever, if I X out of that, it should return me to ‘Your Publications’, so the X should be local/relative to the ‘current sidebar view’, rather than X-ing out of the whole sidebar altogether)
