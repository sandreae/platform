## RHIZOMATIC WEB ZINE

Rhizomatic is a space for community discourse, where publications by contributors act as points of departure for ideas and conversations. Rhizomatic aims to provide a space for community-generated discourse through creative action. Each Rhizomatic community defines itself, and the structures they function within, encouraging conversation through expression.

Contributors create publications within topic-specific Rhizomatic instances and build discourse(s) organically through activity. The publications are created and hosted on rhizomatic.community and can be composed of markdown documents, single media uploads, or mixed-media collages. Each publication invites responses, a discourse emerges from the process of openly expressing ideas.

Rhizomatic is a place where new communities can form, or existing ones can initiate a creative discussion environment.
